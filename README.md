This Python script scrapes Hacker News articles from multiple pages and saves them into both a SQLite database (`hacker_news_articles.db`) and a CSV file (`hacker_news_articles.csv`). The script makes use of the `requests` library to fetch HTML content from Hacker News pages. It uses `BeautifulSoup` for parsing this HTML content. Each page's URL is constructed, starting from the main page and then iteratively for subsequent pages.
The SQLite database table is created if it doesn't exist, ensuring unique article entries via an `id` column. Concurrently, the CSV file is created or opened in write mode (`'w'`), and each fetched article's title and link are written row by row using the `csv.writer`.
To avoid overwhelming the server and getting blocked, the script incorporates a random delay (between 1 to 7 seconds using `time.sleep(randint(15, 20))`) after each page request.
This project effectively demonstrates web parsing using Python, database management with SQLite, and file handling with CSV, providing a practical example of how to automate data extraction and storage from a website.
